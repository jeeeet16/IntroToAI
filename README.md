Pacman AI Search Project

This project demonstrates AI search algorithms in action by navigating Pacman through mazes efficiently. It covers classical search strategies, problem formulations, and heuristic design.

ðŸš€ Features

Search Algorithms implemented:

Depth-First Search (DFS)

Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Uniform Cost Search (UCS)

A* Search (with admissible heuristics)

Custom Search Problems:

CornersProblem: Visit all four corners.

FoodSearchProblem: Eat all food pellets optimally.

AnyFoodSearchProblem: Find the closest food.

Heuristics:

cornersHeuristic â†’ max Manhattan distance to unvisited corners.

foodHeuristic â†’ max maze distance to remaining food with caching for efficiency.

Optimal pathfinding with admissible and consistent heuristics.

Efficient priority queue implementation for UCS and A*.

ðŸŽ® Usage

Run Pacman with your choice of search algorithm and problem:

# DFS on tinyMaze
python pacman.py -l tinyMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=dfs

# BFS on mediumMaze
python pacman.py -l mediumMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=bfs

# UCS on bigMaze
python pacman.py -l bigMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=ucs

# A* with corners heuristic
python pacman.py -l mediumCorners -p SearchAgent -a fn=aStarSearch,prob=CornersProblem,heuristic=cornersHeuristic

# A* with food heuristic
python pacman.py -l trickySearch -p AStarFoodSearchAgent

ðŸ“Œ Key Concepts

State Representation: Efficiently encode only relevant info (e.g., Pacman position + visited corners).

Goal Test: Check if all objectives are achieved (e.g., all corners visited, any food eaten).

Successors: Generate next possible moves and update state accordingly.

Heuristic Design: Ensure admissibility and consistency to guarantee optimal A* solutions.

Priority Queue: Used in UCS and A* to always expand the most promising node.

âœ… Learning Outcomes

Applied DFS, BFS, UCS, and A search* in a grid-based environment.

Designed state representations and heuristics for complex search problems.

Understood the difference between uninformed and informed search.

Optimized search performance using caching and priority queues.
